# qginx

## Introduction
This is a high performance web server. The purpose of this project is to learn about Nginx and implement a simpler version similar with it.

## Development Roadmap
- Version 0: A single-processing and modularized web server. It can process static and dynamic requests. 
- Version 1: A multi-processing web server. It uses Epoll as I/O event notification mechanism, and processes events asynchronously.

## Benchmarking
